# Factors Influencing Life Expectancy
#### A mini-project I did for my CS320 final, predicting life expectancy rates in different countries using supervised and unsupervised machine learning models.


In the past, we have seen that the effect of immunization was not included in the 
studies that determine the factors affecting life expectancy rates considering various 
factors such as composition of income, demographic variables and even the mortality 
rates. Thus, the goal of this project is to focus on economic, mortality, social 
immunization, and various factors to predict life expectancy, which will help suggesting 
countries which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life 
expectancy of its population.

   The data used for this project was collected from WHO and United Nations 
websites and can be found on Kaggle: https://www.kaggle.com/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who. 
This dataset contains 22 columns that include Country, status(developing/developed) and 19 
other features like GDP, alcohol consumption, immunization coverage for diseases, mortality rates, 
education factors and more.

   For analysis I selected all of the 19 features to evaluate their effects on life 
expectancy, 1) year, 2) adult mortality, 3) infant deaths, 4) alcohol consumption, 5)
expenditure on health as a percentage of GDP, 6) HepB immunization coverage, 7) 
measles reported cases (per 1000 population), 8) BMI, 9) under-five deaths, 10) Polio 
immunization coverage, 11) total expenditure on health, 12) DTP3 immunization 
coverage, 13) Deaths per 1000 live births HIV/AIDS, 14) GDP, 15) population, 16) 
thinness 1-19 years, 17) thinness 5-9 years, 18) income composition of resources, and 
19) no. of years of schooling.


   For `Figure 1`, I compared three features 1) no. of years of schooling, 2) Human 
Development Index in terms of income composition of resources, and 3) GDP to show 
how they affect life expectancy in a country, we can see that countries with higher 
education rate, higher-income composition and GDP have a greater life expectancy.
Other features like immunization coverage also show a similar trend, however, other 
features like alcohol consumption, mortality rate, and disease cases represent a 
negative trend i.e. if they are high, life expectancy is lower.

   For `Figure 2`, I used a principal component analysis plot of the transformed data. I 
applied standard scaler on every numerical column to standardize the values, as they 
were not comparable unscaled with a very high explained variance ratio of about 1.0. 
After, scaling it showed an explained variance of about 0.39.

   In order to predict the life expectancy, I created a sklearn PipeLine with StandardScalar and LinearRegression, and used all 19 features to predict it. I performed a train/test split on the data, then fitted the model on the training data. The model achieved a r2 score of 82.5%, score mean of 80.9% and variance of 0.00068, making it a perfect accurate model for what we plan to achieve from it. 
   
   `Figure 3` plots the coefficient weights for each of the features used by the model and infers that the major factor for predicting life expectancy is mortality rate(under-five deaths, infant deaths), schooling, and income composition. We can also infer that prevalence of thinness among children and adolescents, diseases like HIV/AIDS have a negative correlation with life expectancy.

In conclusion, we can say that all of the features given in the dataset are important and the model can be helpful in order to accurately predict and work on efficiently improve the life expectancy of a countryâ€™s population by determining these factors.
